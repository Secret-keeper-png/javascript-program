Javascript:-

- javascript is used for building logics of a web pages.
- javascript is a high level programming language, used in both client side as well as sever side.
- javascript is comes from echma script  so we see the latest version of jaba script in form of echma script.
- Now we used javascript version 6 i.e ES6 (echma-script 6).
- In another way we called ES6 as the vanilla javascript.
-Nodejs is the run time environment of javascript.

Variable:-
- it is a container to store some data.
- In javascript there are 3types of variable are there ...
1. let:- 
let is a type of variable which is used or changing the variable name later.
- Now these days, most of the cases we used let for creating variable.
-let is a block scope code so we have been used 'let' for most of the cases.

2. var:-
- it is a type of variable which is also used for changing a variable in later stage.
- it is used in oldest browser so now a days we don't use var most of the cases.

3. const:- const means constant.

Rules for creating variable name:-

- variable name are cases sensative "a", & "A" is different.
- Only letter , digit, underscore & special character is allowed ,(not even white space).
- Only letter, underscore or special character should be the 1st character only.
- Ex:- let 3oday_is ="monday"  {error}
- Reserve words cannot be a variable name.
ex:- for , while, switch, do-while, console.

Datatypes in JS:-

- datatype is an attributes associated with a piece of data that tells a computer system how to interprit its value.
- in datatype we used "typeof" operator to know that what type of data it is.
-Mainly in javascript there are 2 types of datatype we used:-

1. Primitive Datatype:-

- in JS there are 7 types of promitive datatype we used:-
1. Number:- number are the type of datatype those it contains some numerical values
2. Boolean:- in boolean datatypes we get boolean value like ture/false.
3. Undefined:- data is not define
4. Null:- in this datatype we get null for the value means nothing.
5.bigInt:- in bigInt we will get the big interger value(-999999999 to +999999999) on the above.
6.string:- it is a type of datatypes that can hold some character like names or woed etc..
7.symbol:- in this we get one symbol of more than one value.

2.Reference Datatype:-

- they are the type of datatype which can hold multiple element in a single time.
- they are -> array, object, function 

1. Array:- 
- it is a datatype where we can store similar type of data is a contigious memory location.
- array indexing starts from"0".
- Ex:- let arr = ["ram","hari","sita","bharat"]
                   0       1      2      3

2. Object:-
- it is a reference datatype where we can store more than one element in a single entity.
- mainly objects are working on (key:value) pair.

ex:- 
  
   let emp1 = {
    "name" : "saba",
    "age" : "20",
    "address" : "bbsr",
    "mobile no" : 2323434213,
    "salary" : 34536644
   }

   - in the above example we can see that the left hand side element are the keys & the right hand side value are the values so we can tell that object is a key:value pair structure.
